## Two wolves 1D simulation

### First model
- marks
    - linear decay
- moving dens
    - based on interactions with other wolf, marks and boundary (only by one tile at once)
- interactions
    - meeting wolf, den, boundary or mark always makes the wolf return to its den
- movement
    - based on distance from the den

### Exp mark decay, movement by time
- marks
    - exponential decay
